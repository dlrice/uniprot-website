      The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) finds regions of local
      similarity between sequences, which can be used to infer functional and
      evolutionary relationships between sequences as well as help identify
      members of gene families. Enter either a protein or nucleotide sequence or
      a UniProt identifier (e.g.P00750 or A4_HUMAN or UPI0000000001) into the
      form field. Optionally, change the program parameters with the dropdown
      menus under the form. Click the Run BLAST button.
